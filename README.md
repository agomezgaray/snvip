# SNVIP Dataset
Synthetic  Dataset  of  Objects  Commonly  Used  by Visually-Impaired People in their Everyday Life  
This is the dataset used for a research paper "Object Detection for Assisting Visually ImpairedPeople: Synthetic Dataset and Benchmarking"

The paper addresses the problem of finding objects in their environments, and we construct a synthetic objects dataset based on a survey applied to visually-impaired people.

We provide:  

    A program to download the dataset of synthetic images with bounding box, and a program to construct the dataset:  
        version 1 with dictionary of 50,743 images and 76,690 object instances

        See the data folder for a script to download the files and construct the dataset.
    
    Four trained models on the first version of the dataset (TF format)  
        SSD ResNet-50 FPN  
        EfficientDet D0
        Faster R-CNN Inception v2  
        Faster R-CNN ResNet-50
